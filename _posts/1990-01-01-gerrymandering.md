# Gerrymandering or Political Districting

The "Masachussetts Problem"

_Gerrymandering_ is the practice of partitioning a graph in I have modelled this problem from three different perspectives:

1. Creating an heuristic that finds a gerrymandered solution given an initial district map
2. Defining a combinatorial (optimization) problem with a SAT formulation
3. Defining game theory dynamic
