# Gerrymandering or Political Districting

The "Masachussetts Problem"

_Gerrymandering_ is the practice of partitioning a graph in I have modelled this problem from three different perspectives:

1. Creating an heuristic that finds a gerrymandered solution given an initial district map
2. Defining a combinatorial (optimization) problem
3. Defining game theory dynamic

## 1. Heuristic
I designed and implemented a smart version of a greedy algorithm for faster convergence of a satisfactory partition.

(Here)[assets/gerrymandering_slides.pdf] are the slides of a very short presentation I created to explain how the heuristic works
