# Paper planes

At 16 I conducted a self-initiated study to better understand the aerodynamics of paper planes, the first research project I ever embarked on.
I explored the the relationship between the Lift-to-Drag ratio - also known as aerodynamic efficiency - and a set of wingspans and wing area.
This study was self-initiated in hopes to understand how the gliding of paper planes can be improved, which could evenualy lead to designing a paper plane optimal for maximum distance cover. At the time I was intrigued by gliders and this was an accesible way to model and simulate their flights.

My high school put me in contact with an alumni student majoring in Aerospace Engineering at the time who kindly helped me to develop a Matlab script to run my simulations.
This project was selected for presentation in the [Exoprecerca jove](https://www.magmarecerca.org/en/exporecerca) XIX conference - young researchers international fair -, which took place in Barcelona, March of 2018.
