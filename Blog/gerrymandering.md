# Gerrymandering or Political Districting

I have modelled this problem from three different perpsectives:

1. Creating an heuristic that finds a gerrymandered solution given an initial district map
2. Defining a combinatorial (optimization) problem with a SAT formulation
3. Defining game theory dynamic
