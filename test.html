              <h2>Abstract</h2>
              <p>I am an Aerospace Engineering graduate and final year Computer Science master student currently doing full-time research at Georgia Tech. I am also part-time majoring in Economics with a minor in history of philosophy.</p>

        <!h2>About me</h2>
        

        <p>My research interests have been dwelving from fluid mechanics and turbulence modelling (aerospace) to graph theory and algorithmics (computer science), following my eduacitonal path. My current research focuses in optimal design and PDE-constrained optimization under uncertainty, a topic that exploits knowledge from my previous experiences and requires maestry in techniques relevant for my current and future fields of study. </p>
        <p>You can find some of my recent projects and topics of interest below. </p>

        <p>On the switch from aerospace to computer science and why I am motivaded by almost any research question.</p>
