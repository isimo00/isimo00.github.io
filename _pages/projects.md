### Under supervision
Some notable projects my code has contributed to (not including my BSc and MSc thesis):
- `soupy` library for Stochastic Optimization under high-dimensional Uncertainty in Python, developed by the Scientific Computing and Uncertainty Quantification @ GeorgiaTech. [Github repo](https://github.com/hippylib/soupy) (Python) **2024**
- _Study on the union of hyperbolic graphs_. Private repository, under [Prof. Maria Serna](https://www.cs.upc.edu/~mjserna/)'s supervision. **2023-24**
- `biggr` library, developed by BEEGroup @ CIMNE. [Github repo](https://github.com/biggproject/biggr) (R) **2023**
- `beemeteo` library, developed by BEEGroup @ CIMNE. [Github repo](https://github.com/BeeGroup-cimne/beemeteo) (Python) **2023**
- _Wall modelling using a MLP neural network_ project for turbulent flow boundary layer modeling. Private repository, under [Prof. Bernat Font](https://b-fg.github.io/)'s supervision @ BSC-CSN. (Python)
This was an extracurricular extension of my [aerospace engineering bachelor's thesis](https://upcommons.upc.edu/handle/2117/372288) (for diploma obtention). **2021-22**
- Various $$\LaTeX$$ workflows for automation and templates. Private repository, under [Prof. Rafael Weyler](https://futur.upc.edu/RafaelWeylerPerez?locale=en) and Prof. Josep Pi√±ol's supervision @ UPC, Material Science department. **2021**

### Self-initiated
Some cool self-directed projects I have designed and developed include a bibliography cross-checker for easier detection of paper and article connections, and a few $$\LaTeX$$ snippets that make bibliography presentation in `beamer` easier. Most of the projects under my Graphs page are also self-initiated!
