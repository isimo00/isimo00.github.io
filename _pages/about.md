I am currently working in PDE-constrained optimization under uncertainty under [Prof. Peng Chen](https://faculty.cc.gatech.edu/~pchen402/)'s supervision and in a randomized version of an All-Pair Shortest Path algorithm under [Prof. Richard Vuduc](https://vuduc.org/v2/) at Georgia Tech.

__My research interests__ include graph theory and optimization. In particular, I am interested in how different problems own nature intertwines with classic algorithmic approaches. 
I have been working on gossip spread in Hyperbolic Random Graphs, gerrymandering or political districting and randomized triangle counting in large graphs and networks.

__My studies__ include a Ms in Computer Science for which I am currently finishing the thesis. I am a graduate in Aerospace Engineering (2022), and a Bs in Economics that I am completing part time.

__My working experience__ began as an intern at [Hewlett-Packard](https://www.hp.com/us-en/hp-labs/research/overview.html).  I since have gravitated towards more academic-inclined positions, collaborating with the Barcelona Supercomutng Center ([BSC-CSN](https://www.bsc.es/)) for my [bachelor thesis](https://upcommons.upc.edu/handle/2117/372288), and interning at the International Centre of Numerical Methods in Engineering ([CIMNE](https://www.cimne.com/)) among other collaborations with professors. Since January 2024, I am working full-time as a visiting researcher at [Georgia Tech](https://www.cc.gatech.edu/).
