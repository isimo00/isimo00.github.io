I am a graduate researcher currently working in PDE-constrained optimization under uncertainty under [Prof. Peng Chen](https://faculty.cc.gatech.edu/~pchen402/)'s supervision at Georgia Tech.

My research interests include combinatorics and optimization (and how these discrete and continuous mathematics fields relate). In particular, I am interested in how different problems own nature intertwines with classic algorithmic approaches. 
I have been closely studying election and opinion dynamics, gerrymandering or political districting and gossip games from this and other scopes. (Find more here)

I obtained my Bs in Aerospace Engineering in 2022, and currently I am both completing my Bs in Economics and finishing the thesis for Ms in Computer Science.

My working experience started in [Hewlett-Packard](https://www.hp.com/us-en/hp-labs/research/overview.html) and I have gravitated towards more academic-inclined positions since then, collaborating with the Barcelona Supercomutng Center ([BSC-CSN](https://www.bsc.es/)) for my bachelor thesis, and interning at the International Centre of Numerical Methods in Engineering ([CIMNE](https://www.cimne.com/)) among other collaborations with professors.
