How to synthesize graphs that are high-fidelity representations of real social networks has been a question for quite some time. There are a few very popular - even classic, at this point - approaches, notably the Erdos-Renyi, Bar√°basi-Albert or Watts-Strogatz models. The literature on any of these three is both large and rich. However, it is worth mentioning why none of these are perfect models for real complex social networks. This has prompted the exploration of some of the more recent proposed models; Random Hyperbolic Graphs, GIRGs and others.
